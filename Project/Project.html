        <h1>A nuclear comeback?</h1>
        <h2>Aims:</h2>
        <p>
            A few years ago, as a research assistant exploring nuclear proliferation, I learned about the possibilities provided by nuclear energy. But the word nuclear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_protests">is associated with negative connotations</a> and hence we do not benefit from it as we could. Recently I learned that companies like Google are considering purchasing nuclear reactors to meet their growing energy needs. Indeed, with the rise of Industry 4.0 technologies, energy demands are increasing. So, does nuclear energy have the qualities to compete with more popular energy sources? Who would benefit from its resurgence? I aim to answer these questions with the charts below.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data:</h2>
        <p>
            The following charts should help understand whether nuclear energy has a future and who will lead the sector.
        </p>

            <h3>Is nuclear even safe?</h3>
            <p>
                Nuclear energy is often associated with disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima, which cost lives and damaged environment. But what does data say? I plotted emissions/GWh against death rate/TWh of electricity production in Chart 1. Emissions are represented as CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions, and death rates are the number of deaths caused by accidents and air pollution. Both values cover the entire lifecycle of power plants.
            </p>
            <h4 class="chart-title">Chart 1: Death rate and CO2 equivalent emissions by source</h4>
            <h5 class="chart-description">Source: Our World in Data</h5>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <figure class="chart chart-desktop" id="reliability_safety_figD"></figure>
                <figure class="chart chart-mobile" id="reliability_safety_figM"></figure>
            </div>
            <p>
                Apparently, nuclear energy is one of the safest and cleanest energy sources. That is, while nuclear accidents can be catastrophic, they are rare. This is similar to the airplane vs car/motorcycle safety situation. Moreover, using nuclear plants can significantly reduce emissions, and hence help the environment.

            <h3>Is it cheap?</h3>
            <p>
                Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) is an average cost of generating electricity over the lifetime of a power plant. Chart 2 illustrates changes in LCOE over years for solar, wind and nuclear plants.
            </p>
            <h4 class="chart-title">Chart 2: Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from new plants</h4>
            <h5 class="chart-description">Source: Lazard Cost of Energy, version 17.0</h5>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <figure class="chart chart-desktop" id="LCOE_figD"></figure>
                <figure class="chart chart-mobile" id="LCOE_figM"></figure>
            </div>
            <p>
                Nuclear energy increased in costs and moved from being the cheapest in 2009 to being the most expensive in 2024. Despite challenges in evaluating costs discussed in Analytical Challenges section, nuclear plant construction does have high upfront costs compared to wind and especially solar plants.

            <h3>Is it reliable?</h3>
            <p>
                To replace fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives, we need reliable supply. Which source can we rely on? I <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1katGZ8jSuJb-7ejLqE_2xEs235wtWHbk?usp=sharing">scraped</a> annual capacity factor (which measure how often a power plant runs at its maximum capacity) data for US plants from EIA website using Python to create Chart 3.
            </p>
            <h4 class="chart-title">Chart 3: Capacity factors by energy source</h4>
            <h5 class="chart-description">Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration</h5>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <figure class="chart chart-desktop" id="capacity_factor_figD"></figure>
                <figure class="chart chart-mobile" id="capacity_factor_figM"></figure>
            </div>
            <p>
                Chart 3 shows nuclear plants have by far the highest capacity factor (over 90%). That is not surprising as nuclear power does not depend on seasons, weather, or time of day and requires infrequent refuelling. Geothermal energy is a close competitor but has geographical limitations.
            </p>
        </section>

        <p>
            Nuclear energy may be costlier, but I wonder if solar panels could become so cheap if they received the "hate" aimed at nuclear energy. Its reliability and recent spark in interest suggest nuclear energy could become more popular, which in turn could reduce costs.

            <h3>Who produces the most uranium?</h3>
            <p>
                Nuclear reactors produce vast energy thanks to uranium. Hence, I <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Xy8YPmon4Lo10B3NIS8YkR8dt6-qok9q?usp=sharing">scraped</a> uranium production data from the World Nuclear Association (WNA) website. Chart 4 shows top uranium producers from 2013 to 2022.
            </p>
            <h4 class="chart-title">Chart 4: Global production of uranium by country</h4>
            <h5 class="chart-description">Source: World Nuclear Association</h5>

                <figure class="chart chart-mobile" id="uranium_production_figM"></figure>
            </div>
            <p>
                Kazakhstan has dominated production since at least 2013, with Canada and Australia producing significant amounts but not matching Kazakhstan's level. Playing with top-K limiter and year sliders demonstrates that Namibia has recently risen to the top three.

            <h3>Who has the most uranium?</h3>
            <p>
                While production is important, possessing  uranium reserves is at least equally important. I <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UCZhCfPYkhLhS_IUL9fp0xaEtwcGvTXa?usp=sharing">scraped</a> reserves data from the WNA and illustrated findings on a map.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Australia has by far the largest reserves (28%). There are political issues, resolving which could help Australia become a key supplier. Moreover, a rise in uranium prices could justify the costs of production and hence trigger uranium mining in Australia. Countries like Mongolia have reserves but do not produce yet. Their uranium mining sectors have recently received domestic and foreign investments for production in the future.

            <h3>Who expands international influence?</h3>
            <p>
                Россия! Russia's state corporation Rosatom is the only supplier offering an all-inclusive package. In the nuclear market, Russia is a one stop shop that can provide everything, from reactor construction to flexible financing. 
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                The map shows Russia's engagements with various countries, which I <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bGT_QkanRqgKHfscLRJEp7EtH-k1dnug#scrollTo=6-Bby5v0rAAg">scraped</a> from an article by Szulecki and Overland. Some like Turkey and Bangladesh are building their first nuclear plants. These are long-term projects that tie these countries' energy sectors to Russia for decades. So, in a way Russia aims to maintain its key position in the global energy market even without fossil fuels. As we can see, Russia is expanding to Latin America and Africa in addition to its traditional partners.

            <h2>Analytical challenges:</h2>
            <p>
                The data used in this project are from commonly used reliable sources. However, there are some nuances.
            </p>
            <h3>Death rate and emissions:</h3>
            <p>
                The death rate and emissions data are for state-of-the-art technology in Europe, which has stricter regulations. Hence, situation might be different in other regions. Nevertheless, the difference among energy sources is apparent. 
            </p>
            <h3>LCOE:</h3>
            <p>
                LCOE values are based on assumptions like discount rates. Changing these assumptions affects LCOE values and no single assumption is valid for all energy sources. Thus, although LCOE is commonly used, some <a href="https://www.mackinac.org/blog/2022/nuclear-wasted-why-the-cost-of-nuclear-energy-is-misunderstood">argue</a> that it is not suitable for evaluating plants of different nature.
            </p>
            <h3>Trade data:</h3>
            <p>
                I wanted to use export data to illustrate key exporters of nuclear technology and materials. Almost all sources lead to World Bank’s WTIS, which lacks export data I need for some key countries. Hence, I could not illustrate exports. Hopefully, uranium production will serve as a substitute.
            </p>

        <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
        <p>
            Nuclear energy has so much potential as it is safe, clean, reliable and powerful. But we must also be careful as there are certain risks that needs to be researched further. Proliferation of nuclear energy technologies and fissile materials could be dangerous as they could be used for building nuclear weapons. South Africa is a great example that a country can build nuclear weapons without anyone realizing. What is even more dangerous is that terrorist organizations and organized criminal groups can reach these materials and technologies in countries with weaker controls.
